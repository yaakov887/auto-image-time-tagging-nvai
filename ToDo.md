# Introduction #

There's one file, keywords.py, that can be run to tag images in a command line argument directory. So we need to build on that.


# Details #

**Phase 1**

  * Finish the basement white-board.
  * Create a GUI for the app.

**Phase 2**

  * Learn MATLAB
  * Expand the app capabilities with MATLAB to tag images based on the numbers seen in the pictures rather than the time label on each image.

# Completed #

NOTHING :(
